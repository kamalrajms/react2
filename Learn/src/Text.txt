## useRef

    UseRef(),is a react hook that gives you a box  (.current) youcan store anything in 
    Like number, str, obj, function, even DOM elements

    That value Persists between renders.
    
    Updating it does not causes your component to re-renders

    {current:value}

## Useparam()

        useParams is a React Router hook that lets you access dynamic parameters from the URL.

		It’s commonly used when you have routes with dynamic segments like /users/:id or /products/:productId.

## usecontext()

    Passsing data from a parent component down to deeply nested child component

    Normally ,you'd have to pass props manually through each level (called props)

    usecontext lets you  skip all the middle components and share data directly.

            create a context
            provide a value
            consume the value
